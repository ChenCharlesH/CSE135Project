================================INDICES REPORT==================================

For Sales Analytics, we're constantly accessing the Purchases table of our
database, namely the User and Product fields.  We believe that these two columns
may be good candidates for indexing, since we're frequently accessing them and
never updating them.  We considered indexing the Quantity field, but this field
is sparsely used, and would not likely outperform the overhead of adding such
an index.

=================================Analysis=======================================

As it turns out, using indices on a data set that is only 10 items large
doesn't result in much of a performance increase.  We can observe a minor
performance increase in terms of the runtime of individual queries above, but
when it comes to fully rendering the page, the AJAX and JS appear to dominate.
Utilizing the User and Product indices in the Purchases table could be
beneficial if we ever needed to scale up the number of columns displayed at one
time, however.  Thus, we shall keep them, since they appear to only be helping
increase performance.
