================================INDICES REPORT==================================

For Sales Analytics, we're constantly accessing the Purchases table of our
database, namely the User and Product fields.  We believe that these two columns
may be good candidates for indexing, since we're frequently accessing them and
never updating them.  We considered indexing the Quantity field, but this field
is sparsely used, and would not likely outperform the overhead of adding such
an index.
